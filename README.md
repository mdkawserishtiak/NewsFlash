I created a website inspired by [Julio Codes's YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Aj7HLsJenVg?si=4_07N8U5rpBuE28g). I made it without watching the tutorial. Therefore, the source code is not the same. However, when I felt troubled, I watched his tutorial there. Currently, the website uses HTML, CSS, and Swiper JS. But I will add the custom JavaScript soon. It took 40-50 hours to make. My plan is when I learn new skills like Tailwind CSS, React, etc. I will make this website again using those technologies.

## Features of the website
* Responsive
* Dark & light themes options
* Sign in & Sign up (with fancy border & hover effect) options
* Search option
* Post slider using Swiper JS
* Post template with stylish blockquote & author sections
* Newsletter option
* Social media icons
* Custom scroll-bar
* Maximum content of the site has hover effects and animations
